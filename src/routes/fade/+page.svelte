					Ambitious people are rare, so if everyone is mixed together randomly, as they tend to be
					early in people's lives, then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers. When you
					take people like this and put them together with other ambitious people, they bloom like
					dying plants given water. Probably most ambitious people are starved for the sort of
					encouragement they'd get from ambitious peers, whatever their age."<br />
